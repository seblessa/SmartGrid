# Multi-Agent System for Smart Grid Management
## Overview
The aim is to design and implement a multi-agent system to efficiently manage and optimize a smart grid. Students will create intelligent agents responsible for tasks like load balancing, fault detection, and renewable energy integration within a realistic smart grid environment.

## Objectives
- Develop a multi-agent system to efficiently manage and optimize a smart grid.
- Create intelligent agents with different roles for grid management, including load balancing, fault detection, and renewable energy integration.
- Analyze the performance of the multi-agent system in improving grid reliability and efficiency.

## Features
1. Agent Types: Design various agent types, such as Grid Controllers, Power Generators, and Consumer Agents, each with specific roles and responsibilities in smart grid management.
2. Smart Grid Environment: Model a realistic smart grid environment, including power sources (renewable and non-renewable), power lines, and consumer locations.
3. Agent Behaviors: Define agent behaviors for load balancing, fault detection and recovery, demand response, and integrating renewable energy sources.
4. Realistic Simulation: Create a dynamic simulation of the smart grid, considering factors like power generation, consumption patterns, and grid topology.
5. Performance Analysis: Evaluate the performance of the multi-agent system in terms of grid reliability, efficiency, and response to changing conditions.
